                With the final iteration of the first-gen Mustang, 
                the Grande package carried over many of the same upgrades 
                as before. The distinct interior upgrades were mostly the 
                same, but the hopsack seat inserts were replaced with 
                "Lambeth cloth." The vinyl roof was now standard and 
                available in five colors: black, white, green, blue, 
                or brown. A lighted ashtray was added to the console.
